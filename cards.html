A Mahila Bachat Gat is a Self Help Group of around 10 to 15 women who live in close proximity. They deposit their meager savings in a common bank account and get a loan from the bank on a nominal interest rate. They use this money to undertake income generating activities.

The objective of forming a Bachat Gat is to promote thrift amongst the members and to explore the possibility of starting some kind of self employment at a later stage. It seeks to enhance community development.
